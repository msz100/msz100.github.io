            <p>In Summer 2022, I worked as a machine learning SWE intern at medical imaging startup United Imaging Intelligence near Cambridge, MA. 
                There, I worked with tools such as Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Keras, and Docker to develop a full segmentation and analysis ML pipeline for LGE cardiac MRI imagery, 
                including neural network modules for short axis cMRI myocardial segmentation.</p>

                I've been a classically trained pianist since the age of 5, and I love playing to this day.
                I enjoy lifting, playing soccer, ping pong, as well as ultimate frisbee. I also love drawing/pencil art and cooking.
